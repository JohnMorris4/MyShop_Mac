# MyShop_Mac
This project is a rebuild of the eCommerce website built from my course Real World ASP.NET Development
https://www.completecoder.net/p/real-world-asp-net-development

The original codebase for the course can be found here https://github.com/completecoder/MyShop

This version is the same code but rebuilt using Visual Studio for Mac.

For the backend database I used SQL Linux running in a docker container.
