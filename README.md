# MyShop_Mac
This project is a rebuild of the eCommerce website built from my course Real World ASP.NET Development
https://www.udemy.com/course/better-web-development-pro-techniques-for-success/?referralCode=08A1A0743AA31A4AD50A

The original codebase for the course can be found here https://github.com/completecoder/MyShop

This version is the same code but rebuilt using Visual Studio for Mac.

For the backend database I used SQL Linux running in a docker container.
